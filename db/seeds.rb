I do have to say a couple of negatives to this movie is that when cgi was made and used in a lot of movies George went back on this movie and made it high tech which  i kinda like a little but he did a little to much high tech with the special edition versions of the originals and i kind of with we had the original versions of them on Disney + or on shelves. overall i still love this movie it has a place in my heart.", user_id: 1, movie_id: 1, recommend: 1},

To be honest most of the film doesn't look like made up set-pieces but actual real places they shot in so I am intrigued as to the ratio of how practical it actually is. Back to the acting - this has to be the best if not in the top tier of Willem Dafoe's acting skill tree alone. He literally composes the story.

The story follows a banker named Andy Duphrane who's wrongfully convicted of killing his wife and her lover, and is sent to the Shawshank maximum security prison where he befriends another inmate named Red. Starring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, John Sandler, and Clancy Brown, the film has an impressive cast that gives good performances. Additionally, screenwriter/director Frank Darabont does an excellent job at developing the characters and relationships; making the audience care about them and their plight. The set and costume designs too, are especially well-done; capturing the time-period and giving the prison a real, lived-in feel. Also, the score by Thomas Newman is emotionally evocative and has a soulfulness to it that heightens the material.

I wish that time had been distributed to developing Truman and Sylvia's relationship and created some depth in their relationship beyond infatuation and sudden cutoff, although I'm sure that added to the intrigue and desire for the character.

Charlies angels was a hit show back in the day and, the films that starred Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and, Drew Barrymore were also awful. Trying to resurrect this franchise was a mistake, not only on the production company but also Elizabeth banks as well. She blames the movies lack of success on men not attending the film because it’s starring women. That’s the biggest bunch of crybaby bs I’ve ever heard. I have no issue with women directing a movie at all. American psycho, Wonder Woman, captain marvel and, Wayne’s world are a few examples of movies that were directed by women and, they were all a huge success. Bottom line, the movie was mediocre at best and, you can tell it was directed by someone who doesn’t have very much experience.

Naomi is also a beauty with brains to boot. Elizabeth Banks does a good job as their Bosley and the chemistry is great amongst all of the women. The men in the movie are also very capable and talented and each one plays their role very well. The movie has good action, comedy and sensitivity. Nice car chases and the gadgets are used well and in one scene at the rock quarry with Naomi, well she tried to use the knockout lozenges and they worked, just not on the person intended. It was a tender moment with both Ella and Naomi crashing, Kristen made a great pillow. All three of the Angels had good humor but kicked some serious ass when needed.

It's not just Meryl Streep who invents a new combination of smug and swag as an upper-classed fashionista boss but it's both her young P.As, Emily Blunt and Anne Hathway who have shown a lot of potential in elegantly sticking up to their roles and doing justice to it. Emily Blunt is simply fantastic and has mimicked the lifestyle of a hard-working underrated desperate personal assistant who awefully ends up to be a great disappointment to her boss against all her efforts. It's so subtle an acting style. Anne Hathway on the other hand has shown a character arc of transitioning from a regular girl to being swayed by a swirl of complex charcaters and personas that work with her and she has to put up with them in order to stay in the job. She goes an extra mile always and gets to decide what's best for her life. The other actors in the movie are well cast too. But Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Anne Hathway just stand out.
